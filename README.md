# Flic Hub SDK Module

This module for your Flic Hub uses the [Flic Hub SDK](https://flic.io/flic-hub-sdk)
to connect Flic Buttons with Home Assitant using their
[REST API](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api/rest).

> **Note:** this fork exists purely to make it easier for me to find in future
> because I love this little module and I keep losing it amongst my GitHub
> Stars because the upstream repo name is way too generic.

Use the upstream repo. Give them credit.
